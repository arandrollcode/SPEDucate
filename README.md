# SPEDucate
A home where proper education techniques are used to teach those with special needs.

## Inspiration
Our idea start with a personal connection to learning disabilities within our team. One of our teammates has ADHD, while another has a younger brother who has Autism. From their experiences, we've seen that the resources supporting special education learning are extremely limited. SPEDucate both provides a proper platform to those who have learning disabilities, and demonstrates how to connect with those in need.

<!-- ## Design Process??
We began by creating sketches on the online whiteboard tool called tutorialpoint. In these sketches, we designed a basic UI system for the users. As this website is more catered towards people with learning differences, we knew that we had to make the UI as simple as possible so that the users wouldn't get overwhelmed. Once we had come up with a robust User Interface, we began working on charting out our logic. To do this, we used a free online tool called LucidChart. LucidChart is a tool used to create logic diagrams so that programmers have a clearer path of attack for their programs. We used LucidChart to model how the websites would interact with each other as well as what the website's flow would look like. Once we modeled our logic, we began to assign different segments of SPEDucate to each member of the team. As is common in the development of any project, no matter the size, we hit a few roadblock. As we were going to be creating a tool designed for people with learning differences, we knew that we had to be careful with how we were going to be designing each portion to be beneficial to each condition. -->

## Functionality
Using the exact same sample curriculum, we have tailored each of SPEDucate's tabs to a specific ailment. Looking at each tab, it is evident that each learning disability has its own unique challenges and different methods of learning *must* be used for each one.

### Tackling ADHD
The key to designing our ADHD page was change and progression. From our research, it was clear that one of the biggest challenges those with ADHD have when learning is lack of stimulation. To combat this, we divided each section of our curriculum into separate pages so that the user felt some sort of progression. On each individual page, we also differed the styling to try to combat possible feelings of boredom. Finally, the timer in the top right corner acts as a reminder to keep moving forward, gently nudging the user to move on after a certain amount of time so they don't get distracted for too long.

### Addressing Autism
While learning for ADHD was about stimulation, Autism was the complete opposite. The last thing we wanted was for the user to feel overstimulated. Therefore, we created our interface to be very consistent with no sudden changes that could potentially be detrimental. Our goal was to make the website simple to follow, yet fun to look at the same time! Lastly, once the user finishes the course, they are able to claim a badge, which provides a beneficial sense of accomplishment!

### Breaching Blindness
Although there is already a pre-established method for surfing the web while blind (screen readers), web developers need to be extremely aware of the limitations and features that screen readers have. For instance, screen reader users prefer a very linearly designed website with clear punctuation markings to make flow clearer. Additionally, web devs should be careful about using proper accessibility-friendly elements within their HTML code (e.g. using `<nav>` and `<h1>` instead of a lot of non-semantic `<div>` elements), as screen readers depend greatly on this. We also added in some extra screen-reader-only text to provide those blind users with much needed information.

It is worth considering those with color blindness as well. When designing webpages, it is good practice to be aware that there are many different types of color blindness. Using a [good color palette](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40) is key to opening the doors of any website to as many users as possible.

## Lessons Learned
This was our first time using a proper GitHub environment. We learned how to manage workflow, delegate tasks, and cooperate with a team in a professional environment. The entire project was also very enlighentening for those on our team who did not have much experience with learning disabilities as they read about the struggles that some of their peers faced.

## What's Next for SPEDucate
We hope to continue expanding our site, adding in new resources for even more learning disabilities. Additionally, we want to reach out to our community and see how things like SPEDucate can be implemented in schools and learning sites.
