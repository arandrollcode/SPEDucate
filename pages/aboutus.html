            <p>
                We came to the idea of SPEDucate while we were brainstorming. 
                We had come up with a ton of great ideas but noticed how a majority of our ideas were already made. But then, one of us came up with the basic idea behind SPEDucate.
                Two of our members deal with two of the most common mental disabilities known to man: ADHD(Attentian Defecit Hyperactivity Disorder) and Autism.
                They knew from experience how horrendous the market for education tools designed for people with learning differences. So we decided that enough is enough. And thats how SPEDucate was born.

          <h1>Our Design Process</h1>
          <p>
            We began by creating sketches on the online whiteboard tool called tutorialpoint. In these sketches, we designed a basic UI system for the users.
            As this website is more catered towards people with learning differences, we knew that we had to make the UI as 
            simple as possible so that the users wouldn't get overwhelmed. Once we had come up with a robust User Interface, we began working on charting out our logic.
            To do this, we used a free online tool called LucidChart. LucidChart is a tool used to create logic diagrams so that programmers have a clearer path of attack for their programs.
            We used LucidChart to model how the websites would interact with each other as well as what the website's flow would look like. Once we modeled our logic,
            we began to assign different segments of SPEDucate to each member of the team. As is common in the development of any project, no matter the size, we hit a few roadblock.
            As we were going to be creating a tool designed for people with learning differences, we knew that we had to be careful with how we were going to be designing each portion to be 
            beneficial to each condition.

          margin-top: 50px;">Tackling ADHD</h2>
          <p>
            To tackle the ADHD pages, we had the member of our team with ADHD talk to us about what sort of things trigger their ADHD. We did this to garner information
            on what sort of web elements we had to avoid using. We actually learned something knew about people with ADHD whilst building this website. Our teammate told us that not everything
            could cause their ADHD to kick in. For their ADHD to come into effect, they had to be very slightly bored of something. Upon learning this, our CSS person knew that they had to
            make some sort of stylistic change between each page in our ADHD-specific course. This took the form of a color change in the progression of the background gradient.
            Another element that we have implemented to assist people with ADHD to have better time management is a timer designed by our ADHD teammate.

          margin-top: 50px;">Addressing autism</h2>
          <p>
            For our autistic segment, we simply had to turn to another of our team members. They have a brother who has autism. This brother is also the one who inspired us to make SPEDucate. 
            Our teammate told us about what things cause their brother to become agitated. One such thing was the constant changes within situations. Therefore, we knew that we had to create a 
            constant, boring, but intresting interface. We solved this through the HTML formatting and CSS designing.

          <p>
            Blindness was quite a difficult situation for us to deal with. After all, how is somebody who is visually impared supposed to interact with a visual display?
            We obviously needed some sort of way to communicate what the contents of the page to blind people. This was done through the use of a simple text to speech system.
